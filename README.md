### Game of Life for the Polyglot

This project is to help me formalise my need to read about new languages. I stole the idea from a podcast and the idea is to implement The Game of Life in all the languages I am reading about. Initially the implementation will be poor but hopefully as my skills in each language improve I will go back and refactor/fix old solutions..
